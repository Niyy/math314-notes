```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

```{r}
f <- function(x) 
{
  x ^ 2
}

optim(4, f, method="L-BFGS-B")
```

L = limited memory
B(last) = bounded in case the argument to the function has bounds on it.
BFGS = four dudes names

$par = parameter
 * holds the value that we were calling x*
 
$value
  * holds the evaluation of f at the min value
  
$counts
  * how many steps it took to get to min value
 
$convergence
  * should be 0, if not you will get an error.
