## Expected value

```{r}
N <- 1000
x <- sample(1:6), N, replace=TRUE)

mean(x)

unique(x)

# Gives the estimates of each values probabilities
fhat <- prop.table(table(x))

ux <- 1:6

# Vectorization multiplication
sum(ux * fhat)
mean(x)

df <- data.frame(prop.table(table(x)))
ggplot(df< aes(x, Freq)) + geom_line()
```

Probability density fucntion - expectide value is where all your data is balanced out. If you have values 1,6 equally weighted it would be at point 3.5.

If you weighted 6 heavier than the other numbers you would have to move your value over as well.
